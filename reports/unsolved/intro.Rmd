To start playing around with the functions from these packages we will use the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) data set.
This simple data set has both continuous and categorical variables that make it perfect for showcasing how different functions work.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)

penguins_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv'
dat = read.csv(url(penguins_url), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
dat = dat %>% drop_na()
head(dat)
```

# General plotting with `ggpubr`
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(ggpubr)
require(ggplot2)
```

`ggpubr` allows to make insightful plots quickly for exploration that in turn can be further customized thanks to being built on top of `ggplot2`.

These are useful links for using this package:

- [function reference](http://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/index.html)
- [palettes](http://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/get_palette.html)
- [figure making](http://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggarrange.html)

Next, we will try to answer different questions using this library and `ggplot2`.

## How many penguins of each species did we observe in total?
```{r}
```
## How many penguins of each species and sex did we observe across the different islands?
```{r}
```

## What are the distributions of flipper lengths considering penguin species, sex and islands of origin?
```{r}
```
Alternatively, we can use stripcharts charts:
```{r}
```
## Are the differences of body mass between sexes significant if we control for species and island?
```{r}
```

## What is the relationship between flipper length, body mass and bill length?
```{r}
```

## Could we have sampling bias in the relationship between flipper length and body mass?
```{r}
```

## What is the spearman correlation coefficient between body mass and flipper length?
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

## Create and save a figure
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

# Heatmaps with `pheatmap`
A part from `ggpubr`, one of the most common packages to visualize multiple types of data altogether is `pheatmap`, which allows to combine hierarchical clustering of rows and columns with continuous and categorical data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

# Phylogenetic trees with `ggtree`
Trees are another very common plot to visualize hierarchical patterns. Here, we will use [`ggtree`](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/ggtree-book/chapter-ggtree.html) to visualize the phylogenetic relationships extracted from a multiple sequence alignment of *TP53* across mammals.

## Basic tree
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

## Tree and multiple sequence alignment of *TP53* amino acids
We will follow [Russell J. Gray](https://github.com/RussellGrayxd/Phylogenetics/blob/master/Sequence%20analysis.R)'s approach.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=10}
```
